							<h1>Welcome to the Job!</h1>
							<p>
								Welcome to Melty's! We are working on turning it into a arcade that rivals even Freddy's, 
								but we are a little low on funds, so its pretty empty. Your job is to make sure that the animatronics 
								don't make a mess of the office. Last weekend we had to buy a new desk because the previous guard just 
								left early or something. No sign of him since, so you're here!
								Like I said, we are a little low on funds, so power is limited. Luckily, we have a backup generator.
								Just open the breaker box in front of you and you'll see a crank to power it on. It takes a bit, so just 
								watch the power meter next to it to see if its done charging. I think I mentioned it already, but the animatronics do wander a bit, 
								we are still testing their software, so make sure they don't get into the office. Oh, let me introduce you to the crew. Lumina is the blue and white one,
								but she hangs out in the vents for some reason most of the time (like I said, software is in beta). She won't come in through the doors, so if she tries to come
								in through the vents, use your sonar blast to scare her off, it sends a frequency to her program that sends her away from the office. 
								The vent is above your head, so check in on her with the security system. Next up on the roster is Mark. His code name is Shadow because hes the dark black one. 
								There's also Jaqob. His code name is Golden, because, duh, hes Golden. Last but not least, we got Melty. He's the man himself. Oh, if you're wondering why they look all 
								torn up and trashy, its because we got them discount from the thrift store on 3rd street. We are really low on funds. Last thing before I go, no, you can't have overtime.
								We won't be able to pay you. Your shift is over at 6:00am sharp. We are trying to find another gaurd for the weekend, but if we can't you can come in saturday for a 6th shift.
								The job is pretty boring and not much happens, but you are safe and get paid, so bring some yarn and knit a sweater.
								The phone bill is going to be bigger than a polar bear after Thanksgiving, so I'm going to hang up. Please don't call me, it costs a lot.
